I have some projects here tracking Twitter [suspensions](https://github.com/travisbrown/twitter-watch) and [unsuspensions](https://github.com/travisbrown/unsuspensions), and have published a [list of 143k Twitter Blue subscriber IDs](https://gist.github.com/travisbrown/80c459557d1980ae1c6808384bca8ee9), which I'll soon be updating to include new subscribers after the relaunch.

You can also find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@travisbrown) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/travisrobertbrown/).
